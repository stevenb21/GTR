Here is the transformation report - 6 graphs for each continuous feature (legend below).
This quick report can help spot any features in need of further preprocessing.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
transformall(df,cv)
```


The first column is the data as is, unchanged.

Second column is a qqplot.

Third column is the log transformation of the feature.

Fourth column is the root transformation of the feature.

Fifth column is the feature with mean imputation.

Sixth column is a standardization of the feature.
