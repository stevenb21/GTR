The 'Feature Hints' report ideally gives further clues for feature selection.

The trusty Scree plot will tell you how many features PCA thinks is important (if you can find a good elbow).

The feature importance plot shows how important each feature is to a default random forest fitted for the dependent variable.

And for the Bayesianists and machine learning folks we have an entropy plot for each feature. Theoretically it's a measure of uncertainty for each feature.

```{r}
miscplots(df,depvar,cv)
